                <h3>Yared Yohannes Yehualashet</h3>

                <p>I am an aspiring coder located in New Jersey, north area, but mainly spend most of my time at libraries, lounges, or in classes at my university coding. I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2022 in New York, but am open to working anywhere as long as living expenses are invested. I am currently experienced in java and C++, but I do plan to improve my web building skills. I would say my biggest strength is my ability to focus onto improving myself. However, that is also my biggest weakness as I mainly expect to spend my time doing assignments or side projects.</p>

                <p>I have currently built a file sorting program in C++ and multiple 2D games(rock, paper, sicssors and tic tac toe). I currently only have a hospital queue system in java since most are for school assignments and I plan to improve in C++ because of its functionality. However, I believe my skills in java are equal or better than my C++.
