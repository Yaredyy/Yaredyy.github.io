                <h3>Yared Yohannes Yehualashet</h3>

                <p>I am an aspiring coder located in Secaucus, New Jerssey. I mainly spend most of my time on projects and learning
                    about new techniques. I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2022 in New York City, but I am open
                    to working remotely. I am currently experienced in Java and C++, but I do plan to improve my web building skills.
                    I would say my biggest strength is my ability to focus on improving myself. However, that is also my biggest
                    weakness as I mainly spend my time working on projects.</p>

                <p>I have currently built a file sorting program in C++ and multiple 2D games, including rock paper sicssors and tic tac toe. I currently have a hospital queue system in Java.
                <br>I plan to improve in C++ because of its functionality. However, I believe I am more knowledgeable in Java.
